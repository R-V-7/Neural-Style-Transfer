# Neural-Style-Transfer

# Project Overview
In this project, I have used cycleGAN deep learning model in order to transform an image by applying stylistic features of a particular art form onto the image to generate visually appealing results. CycleGAN is capable of transforming images from one domain to another without paired examples. It employs two generator-discriminator pairs to learn the mappings between domains while maintaining cycle consistency to ensure the transformations are valid and reversible.

# Installation Instructions
To view the results generated after training the model, follow the given below steps:
1.Install the python file given in app.py from GitHub, and save the python file with the name app.py on your desktop.
2.Create a folder and inside the folder, import the app.py file which you had just stored on the computer. 
3.Inside the same folder(in which you imported the app.py file) create another folder by the name of templates.
